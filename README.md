###  Joins In SQL And PGSQL

###  What are SQL Joins?

**SQL join** statements allow us to access information from two or more tables at once. They also keep our database
normalized. Normalization allows us to keep data redundancy low so that we can decrease the amount of data
anomalies in our application when we delete or update a record.

*Types of Join statements*
The type of join statement you use depends on your use case. There are four different types of join operations:

####   (INNER) JOIN: 
Returns dataset that have matching values in both tables
#### LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: 
Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right s
#### RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: 
Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left
#### FULL (OUTER) JOIN: 
Returns all records when there is a match in either the left table or right table
